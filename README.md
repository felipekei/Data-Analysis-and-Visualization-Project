# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project
The general objective of this project is to understand the data obtained from a certain company, focusing on customer service ratings for interactions with agents. For this, we will focus on two objectives:

-Interpreting the data obtained regarding the types of positive and negative surveys from a group of customer service agents.

-Analyze and compare the satisfaction survey results across months based on hypotheses.

Based on these findings, certain action plans will be proposed by the leaders of each team within the company. These improvement plans are beyond the scope of this project, but their results will definitely be linked to the project's objective and will serve as a foundation for their implementation.
